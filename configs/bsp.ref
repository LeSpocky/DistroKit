ptxdist_debug_pci:
  description: |
    In DistroKit, we have platforms with and without PCI.
    For x86_64, we don't want to have lspci, although PCI is available in the
    kernel.
  variants:
    - condition: kconfig.PTXPlatformConfig()['ARCH_X86']
      value: False
    - condition: kconfig.PTXPlatformConfig()['ARCH_ARM64']
      value: False
    - value: True

kernel_dtb_partitions:
  description: |
    A fixed-partitions node is needed for qemu on mips and
    for some upstream devicetrees in v7a_noneon.
  variants:
    - condition: kconfig.PTXPlatformConfig()['ARCH_MIPS']
      value: True
    - condition: kconfig.PTXPlatformConfig().options.get('PLATFORM') == "v7a_noneon"
      value: True
    - value: False

kernel_initrd:
  description: |
    Initrd support is not needed on most embedded systems.
    For v7a and v8a, we use an initrd for the fastboot usecase.
  variants:
    - condition: kconfig.PTXPlatformConfig().options['PLATFORM'] in ('v8a', 'v7a')
      value: True
    - value: False

optee_disabled_features:
  description: |
    OP-TEE is used as secure monitor on STM32MP13x providing power
    management and clock/reset control support. We don't use it as
    part of a trusted boot setup, so we prefer debuggability over
    reduction of the attack surface.
  condition: kconfig.OPTEEConfig()['CFG_STM32MP13']
  present:
    - CFG_DEBUG_INFO
    - CFG_ENABLE_EMBEDDED_TESTS
    - CFG_TEE_CORE_TA_TRACE

rootfs_unused_libraries:
  description: |
    - libatomic is needed on mips and rpi1 by libcrypto, but for simplicity ship it on all platforms
  optional:
  - !!re '/usr/lib/libatomic\.so.*'
